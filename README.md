# Book-Recommender-System
Used a Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset to make a book Recommender system which gives recommendations
of books based on the input (a book from a given list) given by the user. The system works on the item based collaborative filtering method to give 
recommendations. This was an end-to-end project where I used Flask to make the website and deployment was done on Heroku.
